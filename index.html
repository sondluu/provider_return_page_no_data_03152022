        <p>The dDPP Provider Dashboard for this patient is not available at the moment due to their <span id="reason">inactivity in Noom in the last few weeks</span>.</p>

        <p>Sometimes adopting a new habit could feel daunting to a patient, but encouragement from their clinician has proven to help. Check in with your patient about their Noom dDPP activity. We look forward to more positive results for your patient as part of the program.</p>
